# Genomic-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting and detecting genetic disorders using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryarishabh/of-genomes-and-genetics-hackerearth-ml-challenge), contains genetic data that will be used to build and evaluate predictive models. Given the imbalance in the dataset, this project will explore techniques to address class imbalance and enhance model performance.

## Objectives
The key objectives of the project are as follows:
1. **Understanding**: Thoroughly analyze the dataset, identify patterns, and comprehend its structure.
2. **Review**: Conduct a literature review to identify effective machine learning algorithms and techniques used in genetic disorder prediction.
3. **Design**: Develop a machine learning model optimized for unbalanced data, including feature engineering and model selection.
4. **Assessment**: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and assess its effectiveness in predicting genetic disorders.
5. **Analysis**: Analyze the model results, identify key features, and discuss potential improvements.
